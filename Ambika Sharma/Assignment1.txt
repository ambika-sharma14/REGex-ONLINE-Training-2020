                                                                                                                     ASSIGNMENT 1

1.  When we create a user,some hidden files are generated in the directory of the same user at that time.How is  it done?

Ans. hidden file is a folder or file which filesystem utilities do not display by default when showing a directory listing.They are commonly used
         for storing user preferences or preserving the state of a utility and are frequently created implicity by using various utilities.They are not a 
         security mechanism because access is not restricted -usually the intent is simply to not "clutter" the display of the contents of a directory 
         listing with files the user didnot directly create.

2.Make sub directories inside a parent directory by using single mkdir command.

Ans. mkdir-p htg/
        {articles,images,note,done}
        The -p flag tells the mkdir command to create the main directory first if it doesn't already exit(htg,in our case).The words in the brackets are
        part of the "brace expansion list".Each of the items in the brace expansion list is appended separately to the preceding path(/htg).


3. Tac command vs Cat command.

Ans. tac command is used to see the content of a file in reverse order i.e from bottom to top.
        cat command is used to see the content of a file in normal order i.e from top to bottom.
       Syntax:-
                    cat filename.txt or tac filename.txt.
