                                                                                                        Python 1 Assignment


1. What is JPython & CPython?

Ans. 1) CPython:- a)  It is the most widely used interpreter in Python, developed in C and python, the bindings for the interpreter must be written in a foreign 
                                  language other than Python.  CPython uses a Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) on each process thus python bytecode for a single process is 
                                  executed on a single thread.

                              b) This interpreter is not suitable for CPU intensive algorithms. CPython finds its use as many libraries are C optimized i.e. 
                                   many libraries will run its processes faster in a C based code. Also, python is a dynamic programming language as it allocates the resources                     
                                   on the go not considering future consequences.

                               c)  However, when the same code is defined for CPython based compiler systems the type definition is taken into consideration.
                                    The steps of compilation are as follows:- Decoding, Tokenizing, Parsing, AST(Abstract Syntax Tree), Compiling.

    2) Jython or Jpython:-  a)   Jython is an implementation that has been designed for the seamless integration of Python code over Java virtual machine, 
                                                 the advantage of this integration is that it provides an opportunity for amalgamation of a popular scripting language 
                                                 like python to a vast library of the Java virtual machine.Jython compiles files to .class extensions.

                                           b)  The Jython programs can inherit and run any Java class and compile the code to bytecode. Along with this Jython can be used to
                                                 implement any Java-based packages especially desirable for creating solutions using Servlets,Swing, SWT, and AWT packages
                                                 Jython was created in 1997 by Jim Hugunin. Jython uses the Global interpreter lock (GIL) like CPython.




2. Basic difference between Python2 & Python3?

Ans:-                                        Python 2                                                                                              Python 3                        

     1. It is the more stable and transparent version of the python programming                  1. It is the future of Python designed to address the design flaws in the  
        language.                                                                                                                                previous versions.

     2. The print-syntax is treated as a statement rather than a funtion which                      2. The print is explicitly treated as a function in Python 3 which requires
         requires text to be wrapped in paranthesis.                                                                       an extra pair of paranthesis.

      3. ASCII string type is used by default to store strings.                                                    3. Unicode is the imlicit string type by default.

      4.It simply returns an integer to the nearest whole number when dividing                    4.It makes integer division more intuitive by using true division for
         two integers.                                                                                                                        integers and floats.

      5.Xrange function reconstructs the sequence everytime.                                                  5. Xrange is replaced by range ( ) function in Python 3.


3. Difference between ASCII  and Unicode?

Ans.                            ASCII                                                                                                                                 Unicode

      1.The ASCII or American Standard Code for Information Interchange                                 1. Unicode is a computing industry standard for consistent encoding,
         is a character encoding standard for electronic communication.                                          representation, and handling of text expressed in most of the world's
                                                                                                                                                           writing systems.
           
   
      2. ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange.                         2.  Unicode stands for Universal Character Set.
                        
      3. ASCII contains representations for digits, English letters, and other symbols.                 3.  Unicode supports a wide range of characters
         It supports 128 characters.
   
      4. The ASCII uses 7 bits to represent a character .                                                                4.  The Unicode uses 8bit, 16bit or 32bit depending on the encoding
                                                                                                                                                             type.
                                                                 
      5. The ASCII   reuries less space than Unicode.                                                                     5. The Unicode requires more space than ASCII
